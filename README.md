# Word Building Game
### Disclaimer: An LLM was used in creating the  `README.MD`
**Word Building Game** is a simple and engaging vocabulary-based web game inspired by a word-chain activity I often play with my mother. Each word must start with the last letter of the previous one, creating a continuous chain. The project showcases interactive web development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a chain of valid words (minimum 3 letters), where each new word begins with the final letter of the previous word. The game alternates turns between the player and the computer.

## 🕹️ Features
- Clean and intuitive user interface  
- Responsive, mobile-friendly layout  
- Real-time input handling  
- Simple and efficient JavaScript game logic  

## 📌 How to Play
1. Enter any valid word with at least 3 letters.  
2. The computer responds with a word that starts with the last letter of yours.  
3. Continue the chain and enjoy the game!
