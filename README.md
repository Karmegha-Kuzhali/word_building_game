# Word Building Game 

Word Building Game is a simple yet engaging vocabulary-based web game, inspired by a game I often play with my mother. The core idea is to build a chain of words, where each word starts with the last letter of the previous one. This project serves both as a lighthearted language activity and a small demonstration of interactive web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🎯 Objective
To enter valid words (minimum three letters long), each beginning with the last letter of the word before it. The game continues in this pattern, alternating between the player and the computer.

🕹️ Features
Intuitive and clean user interface

Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

Real-time input handling

Simple game logic using JavaScript

📌 How to Play
Enter any valid word (minimum 3 letters).

The computer responds with a word starting with your word’s last letter.

Continue the chain and enjoy!
